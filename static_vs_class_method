# In Python's object-oriented programming (OOP), both static methods and class methods are used for different purposes, and understanding when to use each can help you design cleaner and more modular code.

### Static Method (`@staticmethod`)

# - **Purpose**: A static method is a method that belongs to the class, but it doesn't have access to the class or instance itself. It's just like a regular function but it lives in the class's namespace.
# - **When to use**: Use a static method when you need a utility function that doesn't need access to the class or instance. It's often used to perform tasks that are relevant to the class but don't require any interaction with the class attributes or instance attributes.

# **Example**:
# ```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

# Usage
result = MathOperations.add_numbers(5, 10)
print(result)  # Output: 15
# ```

### Class Method (`@classmethod`)

# - **Purpose**: A class method is a method that has access to the class itself through the `cls` parameter, and it can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.
# - **When to use**: Use a class method when you need to access or modify class-level attributes or when you want to create factory methods that return instances of the class.

# **Example**:
# ```python
class Employee:
    raise_amount = 1.05  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    @classmethod
    def set_raise_amount(cls, amount):
        cls.raise_amount = amount

    def apply_raise(self):
        self.salary *= self.raise_amount

# Usage
Employee.set_raise_amount(1.10)  # Changes raise_amount for all instances

emp1 = Employee('Alice', 50000)
emp2 = Employee('Bob', 60000)

emp1.apply_raise()
emp2.apply_raise()

print(emp1.salary)  # Output: 55000
print(emp2.salary)  # Output: 66000
# ```

### Summary
# - **Static methods**: Use when you need a function that doesn't interact with the class or its instances.
# - **Class methods**: Use when you need to modify or interact with the class itself (like class attributes) or to provide alternative constructors for the class.
